          For this assignments, I will analyze the accessibility and usability of the accordion component in three applications: Safari Browser History, Zotero, and Visual Studio Code.
          Some screenshots of the accordion components (under various states) in these applications are shown below <b>(For the vibes, in the form of accordions)</b>.

        <h2>Part 1: Input</h2>
        <h3>Interaction Processes & Differences</h3>
        <p>
          Across the three applications—Safari Browser History, Zotero, and Visual Studio Code—mouse usage generally allows basic selection, opening items with clicks or double clicks, and right-click for additional options. However, Safari’s history list requires a double click (rather than a single click) to open a page, which feels unintuitive. Zotero enables double-click editing but doesn’t allow multi-select via mouse. In VS Code, mouse interactions can include drag-and-drop in the file explorer, but no shift-based multi-select in certain views.
        </p>
        <h3>Functionalities & Usability Observations</h3>
        <p>
          With the keyboard, Safari supports arrow-key navigation and multi-select with Shift, but it doesn’t provide access to “Clear History” or open-in-new-tab functionality. Zotero’s keyboard approach lets users edit text fields immediately on focus, but again lacks multi-select. VS Code offers extensive keyboard shortcuts, though Tab can be overridden by code indentation, and toggling between editing mode and navigation can be tricky. Touch interactions are only partially available: Safari offers a long press for context options, while Zotero and VS Code lack dedicated mobile versions, effectively removing multi-select or editing features on touch devices.
        </p>
        <h3>Learnability, Memorability, Efficiency, and Mobile Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          Each component’s learnability depends on how familiar users are with standard interaction patterns: Safari’s double-click requirement is surprising, Zotero’s auto-entry into edit mode can be unexpected, and VS Code’s Tab indentation may confuse users expecting typical UI navigation. Over time, these behaviors become memorable, but they’re less efficient initially. For applications without mobile/touch support (Zotero, VS Code), essential functionalities (editing, multi-select, or drag-and-drop) do not translate to a mobile experience. This limits efficiency and learnability for users accustomed to the desktop versions, potentially causing frustration when switching to mobile or tablet usage where those interactions are unavailable.

        <h2>Part 3: State Models & Redesign</h2>
        
        <p>
          My redesign of VS Code's exploratory panel, which enhances user's experience in exploring nested accordion structures. Previously, users had to "expand" or "collapse" individual accordions, which is time-consuming and can be confusing for users with visual impairments. 
          For example, they may expand a few nested accordions only to notice this is not the branch they intended to explore. Thus, they would have to manually collapse each of them before expanding the next branch, hoping it it intended.
          In the redesign, I introduce a "show all" and "hide all" buttons that allow users to expand or collapse all accordions at once, providing a more efficient way to navigate complex nested structures.
          The tradeoff here is information overload. If all nested accordion options are displayed at the same time, it could be too much to be comprehendible at once, especially for expert users who are very familiar with the directory structure. However, this can be mitigated by providing a clear visual hierarchy and grouping of the nested accordions.

          Here's another redesign of the VS Code Explorer Panel to include depth indicators for nested file structures, enabling immediate awareness of each folder or file’s level. This removes guesswork or memorization for users (improving learnability), and consistent depth cues reinforce how items are structured (boosting memorability). By instantly revealing the current depth, navigation becomes faster and more intuitive (increasing efficiency), and announcing depth levels via screen readers ensures a clearer understanding for visually impaired users or anyone who struggles with spatial awareness (enhancing accessibility).

        <h2>Part 4: Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          In Safari, Zotero, and VS Code, many basic UI features work well for usability and accessibility—such as clear visual focus states, arrow-key navigation, and highlighting selected entries. However, they sometimes miss deeper accessibility elements like announcing depth in nested structures. My redesign in the VS Code Explorer Panel adds explicit depth indicators, reducing guesswork for everyone and providing critical clarity for screen readers and users with limited spatial memory.
        </p>
        <p>Some accessibility considerations—like ensuring the visualization of depth of nested features can be easily interpreted by people with visual impairments—aren’t always addressed in these applications. In my redesign, I account for this by announcing depth levels audibly and visually, solving a “mismatch” between hierarchical navigation and a user’s ability to track complex nesting (as described in Kat Holmes’ framework).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Keyboard-Only:</strong> If depth isn’t announced, users navigating complex folders can get lost. Adding verbal depth cues reduces cognitive strain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mouse &amp; Motor Impairments:</strong> Reliance on hovering or drag-and-drop can exclude users with limited precision; adding explicit click-based navigation ensures more inclusive access.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Historically, mouse and keyboard interactions are most commonly prioritized in component design. This can marginalize touch users and screen-reader users who rely on well-defined focus and spoken feedback, ultimately impacting learnability and efficiency for those groups. By designing with screen-reader and touch inputs in mind from the start, we create more inclusive, intuitive experiences for all.</p>
